# This is a simplified version of the tailwindcss nav

Example site: [https://tailwind-nextjs-nav.vercel.app/](https://tailwind-nextjs-nav.vercel.app/)

This is just taken from the "Centred with bottom border" header from [here](https://tailwindui.com/components/marketing/elements/headers), but simplified for use on smaller sites.

I found myself reusing this menu quite a bit but only needing the skimmed down version. (Though I do like the original).
This uses:

- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- @headlessui/react
- @heroicons/react/outline

### How to use:
Two options

1. Download full site from Github [here](https://github.com/connherf/tailwind-nextjs-nav)

2. Copy the Nav.js file to your components directory and assuming you already have your Next.js app configured with Tailwind CSS, just do:

- npm install @headlessui/react
- npm install @heroicons/react

## Changing Icons
